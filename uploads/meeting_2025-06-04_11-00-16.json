I'm just reading the documentation and checking what it is about.  Yeah. Sure. I'll talk to Frank because yeah, he's the lead in the, yeah, you shouldn't  move with the chat. So yeah.  Yeah, but it should be available in those language too. Okay. The thing is, it's not turned  on yet for any language, so I'm proud. Okay. That's you on RC.  Yes, exactly. It's all captured and good to go, but it's not on. And I don't think we will turn  there's on now only later on.  Let's do a walk through the flow. I'll show you how it works. I'll turn on the server on RC and show  how it will work, but it's also working for Italian and Spanish. Okay. It's stashed on those  language. Sure. And it's good. It's stashed in all language, so it should be good to be turned on,  but it's not because of the server. And I think we will only turn it on in September. I'll  confirm that it would eat. Yeah. Okay. Because it's the same as with the talk to Santa,  which will not be made available just now. Yeah. That's what I heard, but I may be wrong yet.  Now I mean turned on project time. I mean, it's asking for time, so let's suppose  that's all about this.  Yeah, so yesterday I worked on the money board for the for Kinder. I integrated it with  the content teams board for for a tube. I don't know if you saw it, Brian, but I shared with you  your honor of it, too. I also worked on the email that users receive when they create the account,  so to remove the sentence about password, which was simple. I have to send that to review.  And today, my plan is to start working to finish the algebraic line because I started in  last print. So I will focus on that today and tomorrow's because I need to share that with  Pascal and then Pascal and Andrew will do some updates to the plan. It's for the new  content easier. And there is a Kinder meeting today. I need to go home with Brian. I'll be  attending that. I also had a conversation with Emily about that, so I know where things are  regarding the concepts and the script. We can post us about this. Let me see. Yeah, that's it.  The priorities, Kinder today, and I need you to check my sprint.",
