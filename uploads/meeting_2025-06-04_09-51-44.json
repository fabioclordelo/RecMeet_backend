The transcription was working, and it was correct, but the summary was always in English before. Let's see now.\n\n**Summary**\n\nThe focus of this meeting was to test whether the meeting summary would be generated in the language used during the meeting, as initially intended.

Language Detection: The speaker is testing the system's ability to generate summaries in the same language as spoken during the meeting.\n2. Previous Performance: Historically, the transcription was correct, but summaries were always provided in English.\n\n**Decisions Made**\n\nNo decisions were made during this meeting.\n\n**Action Items**\n\nNone were specified.\n\n**Next Steps**\n\nAwait results to see if the summary is generated in the spoken language."
