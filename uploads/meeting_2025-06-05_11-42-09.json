You're gonna be the first person to transition from a human body to a synthetic. Because I'm special. That's right. You're very... very... special. We have a down space travel. I or one, what's on the ship? We can do it. We're fast, we're strong, we don't break. Take a zoo, but the animals got out. This ship collected five different life forms from the darkest corners of the universe. Monsters. Invasive species. Predatory. We don't lock them down. It will be too late.\n\nMario Kart World is just two days away and fan expectations are rightfully high. It's the flagship launch game for Nintendo Switch 2, the first open world in the series, the follow-up to the hugely successful Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and on top of all that, it's Nintendo's first $80 game since the N64 days, which has caused no shortage of internet discourse. There's a lot riding on this one, just to report that after spending roughly five hours with unrestricted access to the final build, I'm confident Mario Kart World's thrilling racing will kick off Nintendo's eighth generation with a rocket start, even if I'm still not completely sold on its open world exploration.\n\nMy first hands-on preview back in April was very limited. Steering Assist was turned on, the demo was locked to 100 cc, and we only got to see a couple of modes. But this time, the training wheels came off, and I played what appeared to be the version you'll be able to buy on June 5th, complete with an enormous roster of characters, including everyone's favorite, cow, and freedom to choose any mode or settings I wanted.\n\nSo I first chose to play as Mario, I know that's basic, and swapped between multiple carts, including the incredible Rob Bike, to try out free roam, which is still the biggest question surrounding Mario Kart World. In a series first, free roam takes the spotlight off of racing and shines it directly on exploration, allowing players to drive across the wide, interconnected highways. Nintendo promised hundreds of p-switch missions in free roam, and while I won't spoil the final total, I can confirm that it only takes a few seconds of driving in any direction to spot one of these challenges. They are littered everywhere, and after worrying they'd all be too easy based on the footage Nintendo has released so far, I was pleasantly surprised that I failed all of the p-switch missions on my first attempt, by either running out of time or missing a key jump, and some of them felt like the demanded mastery of Mario Kart World's new Tony Hawk inspired parkour mechanics.\n\nOne mission in the Bowser's Castle area had me driving on walls and flipping off the side at the right moment to transform into an airplane, and the timing was genuinely tricky, but you're thankfully given the option to retry a challenge immediately after failing rather than having to drive back to the start on your own. P-switch missions can also summon temporary objects and creatures to the terrain, like one where I had to steer my airplane around a few dinosaurs that showed up.\n\nHow's that girl? She's ready.

I want what's on the ship. We can do it. We're fast. We're strong. We don't break. It's okay to do it, but the animals got out. This ship... collected fire. We can do it. We're fast. We're strong.
